🟦 Belt Geometry Solver & Visualizer  
A Python library for computing and visualizing belt paths across any number of pulleys.
The solver computes center‑to‑center geometry, tangent points, wrap angles, belt length, and produces clear matplotlib diagrams showing arcs and straight belt runs.
This project models both open and crossed belts and supports CW/CCW pulleys in arbitrary 2D layouts.


✨ Features  
• Accurate tangent geometry between multiple pulleys  
• Supports clockwise (+1) and counter‑clockwise (‑1) pulley directions  
• Computes wrap angle and wrap length for each pulley  
• Calculates incoming and outgoing belt contact points  
• Computes total belt length (arcs + tangent segments)  
• Computes reaction forces and angles for a constant tension belt (proportional to the belt tension)  
• Visualizes the belt with color‑coded arcs and straight lines  
• Pulleys drawn as filled circles  
• Uses bright, fully saturated HSV colors  
• Clean object‑oriented design  


📦 Installation  
pip install matplotlib numpy  
Copy BeltObject.py and PulleyObject.py into your project directory.  


🧱 Basic Usage  
• Create pulleys  
from Pulley_object import PulleyObject  
from belt_object import BeltObject  
p1 = PulleyObject(radius=20, x_position=0,   y_position=0,   direction="CW")  
p2 = PulleyObject(radius=40, x_position=150, y_position=50,  direction="CCW")  
p3 = PulleyObject(radius=30, x_position=80,  y_position=140, direction="CW")  

• Build the belt  
belt = BeltObject(p1, p2, p3)  

• Compute geometry  
length = belt.compute()  
print("Total belt length:", length)  

• Draw the belt  
belt.draw_belt()  


🧠 How It Works   
The solver calculates:  
• Center‑to‑center distances and angles  
• Tangent geometry using signed pulley radii  
• Local and global tangent angles  
• Wrap angle based on how the belt enters and exits each pulley  
• Exact contact points on each pulley  
• Total belt length by summing arc lengths and straight segments  
• A complete belt path suitable for plotting or CAD export  

All math is designed so:  
• Tangent points lie exactly on the pulley circumference  
• Wrap angles are always correct for CW/CCW pulleys  
• Both open and crossed belt paths work automatically  
• Tangent segments meet arcs perfectly  
• Zero‑wrap cases behave correctly (straight‑through tangent)  


📚 Class Overview  
PulleyObject  
• Represents a single pulley with radius, 2D position, and rotation direction.  
• Accepts directions: 1, -1, "CW", "CCW".  
• Validates numeric inputs and normalizes direction internally.

BeltObject  
• Given multiple pulleys, computes tangent lengths, wrap angles, contact points, and total belt length.  
• Provides helper functions for retrieving geometry and producing color‑coded belt visualizations.
